Over the Peak
=============
This intends to implement another Socksv5 proxy using NodeJS. Planning features
like:
* content filtering, basing on multiple rules.
* encrypted forwarding, including hidding the traffic under protocols like
  HTTP, HTTPS or even XMPP.

A friendly webUI should be implemented.
